### Situation (S): 
In the end week of CIS 430 class, I was asked to form a team of 4 members to solve an identified problem on ASU campus by using technologies that we had learned. 
### Task (T): 
Our goal was to create an interactive website of Ras Signaling that would help the project publication by saving researchers/pubilshers' time to navigate the project instead of reading through the long paper. 
### Action (A): 
I design a new web page to by studying online libraries for web design, such as GOJS, a JavaScript library for implementing custom interactive diagrams and data visualizations (ref. https://gojs.net/latest/index.html). However, it doesn't work well for this project because it requires high-level customization. So I choose to write pure JavaScript code to define various links and nodes. Also, I use PhotoShop to move the links explanation to the top so it shows details by hovering mouse. I update the project once the graduate student has updated data/requirements. To make it easy for the gradute student, I use NodeJS to convert the shared Excel sheets data into JSON data so he can focus on spreadsheets without worring about web design.  
### Result (R):
The graduate student and lab leader are satisfied with my work which is an innovative way to display complex biomedical projects with dragable and clickable noeds, various types of links and other functionalities. This website is ahead of the paper publication date in July.
